# Rashun

**A macOS menu bar app that tracks your free AI coding tool usage so you don't burn through your quota before the month is over.**

If you're a student (or anyone) relying on free-tier AI tools like [Amp](https://ampcode.com) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), you know the pain: you're deep in a project, it's day 22, and suddenly you've hit your limit. Rashun sits quietly in your menu bar, shows you how much you have left at a glance, and nudges you when you're burning through tokens too fast.

---

## Features

- **Menu bar at a glance** — A brain icon fills up (or empties out) to reflect your average remaining quota, with a percentage right next to it.
- **Multiple sources** — Ships with support for **Amp Free** and **GitHub Copilot**. Enable whichever ones you use.
- **Smart notifications** — Get alerted when your remaining usage drops below a threshold, when you're burning through tokens unusually fast, or when you're on pace to run out before the month ends.
- **Configurable polling** — Set how often Rashun checks your usage (default: every 2 minutes).
- **Preferences UI** — Toggle sources on/off, expand notification rules, and tune thresholds — all from a native settings window.
- **Extensible by design** — Adding a new AI source is as simple as dropping a single Swift file into `Sources/AISources/`. The build script auto-discovers it.

## How It Works

Rashun polls each enabled source on a timer. For each source, it fetches the current usage data (remaining quota vs. total limit), calculates the percentage remaining, and updates the menu bar icon accordingly. It also evaluates any enabled notification rules against the current and historical usage data, sending macOS notifications when conditions are met.

| Source | How it fetches data |
|---|---|
| **Amp** | Runs `~/.amp/bin/amp usage` and parses the output |
| **Copilot** | Uses `gh auth token` to authenticate, then hits the GitHub Copilot internal API |

---

## Prerequisites

- **macOS 11+** (Big Sur or later)
- **Swift 6.2+** toolchain (ships with recent Xcode versions)
- For **Amp** monitoring: the [Amp CLI](https://ampcode.com) installed at `~/.amp/bin/amp`
- For **Copilot** monitoring: the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderheffernan/rashun.git
cd rashun
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

`build.sh` will:
1. Auto-generate the source registry from `Sources/AISources/`
2. Build a release binary via `swift build`
3. Package it into `Rashun.app` with proper code signing
4. Launch the app

After the first build, `Rashun.app` is in the project root. You can move it to `/Applications` if you like — just re-run `build.sh` after any updates.

---

## Usage

Once running, you'll see a **brain icon** in your menu bar with a percentage.

1. **Click the icon** to see a breakdown of remaining usage per source.
2. **Open Settings** (`⌘,` from the menu) to enable/disable sources and configure notifications.
3. **Hit Refresh** to manually poll all sources.

### Notification Rules

Each source comes with built-in notification rules you can toggle on:

| Rule | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Percent remaining below** | Fires when your remaining usage drops below a threshold (e.g., 50%) |
| **Recent usage spike** | Fires when you burn through a large chunk of quota in a short time window |
| **Monthly pacing alert** *(Copilot only)* | Fires when your usage rate is on track to exhaust your quota before month-end |

All thresholds and time windows are configurable in Settings.

## Adding a New Source

Rashun is designed to make adding sources trivial. To add a new one:

1. **Create a new file** in `Sources/AISources/` — e.g., `ClaudeSource.swift`
2. **Define a struct** conforming to `AISource`:

```swift
import Foundation

struct ClaudeSource: AISource {
    let name = "Claude"
    let requirements = "Describe what the user needs installed/configured."

    func fetchUsage() async throws -> UsageResult {
        // Fetch remaining and total quota however you need to
        return UsageResult(remaining: 80, limit: 100)
    }
}
```

3. **Run `build.sh`** — it auto-discovers any struct conforming to `AISource` in that directory and registers it. No other wiring needed.

### Custom Notification Rules

Sources can also define their own notification rules by implementing `customNotificationDefinitions`. See `CopilotSource.swift` for an example of the monthly pacing alert.
